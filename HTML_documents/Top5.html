		<h1>Top 5 Womens All Mountain Snowboards 2022/2023</h1>
				<p> 
				Here's the top all mountain snowboards for women winter 2022/2023 ranked by 
				<a href="https://snowboardingprofiles.com/">"Snowboarding Profiles"</a>. 
				You ready to hit the park? Bomb down some groomers? Or maybe some powder in the trees? Regardless 
				of where you ride on the mountain, these boards will get you there! 
				</p>
		
		<h3> 5. Jones Airheart 2.0<h/3>
			<blockquote src="https://snowboardingprofiles.com/the-best-all-mountain-snowboards-for-women-my-top-6">
				<p> 
				Next up we have the Airheart 2.0 - another of the more aggressive boards on this list. 
				If you like to charge hard and carve all day but still want something that's not impossible 
				to slow down on, then the Airheart is a great option. <br><br>
				It's a hard charger, but it's also something that performs well on jumps and you can certainly
				ride it switch and spin etc. In the park it definitely prefers the jump line over the jib line.

		<h3> 4. Yes Hello </h3>
			<blockquote src="https://snowboardingprofiles.com/the-best-all-mountain-snowboards-for-women-my-top-6">
				<p> 
				The YES Hello is kind of like a mellower and lower price version of the Hel Yes (see #1 on this list).<br><br> 
				If you like you like a board slightly only the softer, more playful side, but still with a stable feel underfoot 
				and something that's versatile enough to go anywhere and do anything, the Hello should be making your shortlist. <br><br>
				It's the easiest going, most playful ride on this list - and also the least expensive.

		<h3> 3. Burton Feelgood </h3>
			<blockquote src="https://snowboardingprofiles.com/the-best-all-mountain-snowboards-for-women-my-top-6">
				<p> The Burton Feelgood is the most aggressive board on this list. If I did a separate list for aggressive 
				all-mountain women's boards, then that's where this would belong (along with the Airheart 2.0 and Arbor Swoon
				Camber at #5 and #6 respectively). <br><br>
				The Feelgood is one of the more aggressive carving machines in women's snowboarding and has a take no prisoners 
				attitude. If you don't ride this board, it will ride you.<br><br> 
				If you're an experienced rider who likes to bomb hard and carve up a storm, and you don't need something for deep 
				powder, then the Feelgood should be squarely on your radar.<br><br> 
				There is also a "Flying V" version of the Feelgood - which is a completely different beast - it's softer and more 
				playful and really quite different strengths and weakness to the Feelgood camber. I have included the scores for 
				both below - you'll see how different they ride.

		<h3> 2. Jones Twin Sister </h3>
			<blockquote src="https://snowboardingprofiles.com/the-best-all-mountain-snowboards-for-women-my-top-6">
				<p> 
				If you’re looking for a board that is strong, or at least above average in every single category, then 
				the Twin Sister might just be that board.<br><br>
				This board will be a great partner on the mountain wherever you venture to and in whatever style you want
				to ride – be it a playful jaunt down the mountain, creative freestyle riding, laying down some hard carves,
				bombing down steeps, shredding through the trees or venturing into powder.<br><br>
				Basically, if you wanted to write a definition of "do-it-all" you'd simply have to show a picture of the 
				Twin Sister.

		<h3> 1. Yes Hel Yes </h3>
			<blockquote src="https://snowboardingprofiles.com/the-best-all-mountain-snowboards-for-women-my-top-6">
				<p> 
				The Hel Yes is one of those boards that has that uncanny ability as a board that you can ride quite 
				aggressively on but then you can also dial it back and be more playful with it as well. <br><br>
				There's nothing this board can't do and nowhere that it can't go. An all-rounder that meets the definition
				of do-it-all, go anywhere, anytime.  It's also a great option for those that see icy conditions regularly.<br><br>
